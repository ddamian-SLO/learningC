Relearning the C programming language in order to get more of a grasp on programming as a whole

## Reading Material
I am using "The C Programming Language" by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie as reference and reading material. 
The repo will contain all exercises contained within the book. I'm not going to include the examples in the chapters themselves, just the "do it yourself" portion of the book.
